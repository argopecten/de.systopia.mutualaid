# Further use

CiviCRM has many features and extensions that could help you manage your Mutual Aid Groups.

## Searching 

CiviCRM Advanced Search (Navigation Menu > Search > Advanced Search) lets you find specific sets of contacts, such as all contacts who are offering a specific kind of help, or have a specific relationship status such as Communicated or Cancelled. With the results you can then run **Actions** such as export to CSV, creating mailing labels, mass email, display results on a Map, add a tag, or delete them.

For more information on Searching, see [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/the-user-interface/searching/) and on Search Actions, see [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/the-user-interface/searching/#the-search-action-workflow).

## Bulk email

You can send bulk email to contacts who have registered using CiviMail, or through a Search Action from a search result using CiviMail. For more info, see [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/email/what-is-civimail/).

## Smart Groups

Smart Groups are a powerful feature of CiviCRM to turn search queries into a permanently updated group of contacts which can then be contacted, exported, mapped, etc. For instance you could search (Navigation Menu > Search > Advanced Search) for everyone who has asked for, or offered help, with shopping and save that as a Smart Group called *'Shopping'*. Then if you want to update them about changes to local shop availability or rules you can send a mass email or SMS.

For more information on Smart Groups, see [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/organising-your-data/smart-groups/)

## Mapping

Clicking on any contact record will give you a link to let you see them on a Map, and if you are using Google Maps offer directions. There are a few ways to view multiple contact records on a map - one described above is to run a search, and then run a *Search Action* on the results to *Map Contacts*.

Another method uses Profiles. Profiles are a system within CiviCRM to build custom lists and maps of contacts based on criteria you define. You could create a profile that displays name, address and help offered - then display all your contacts on a map, or use a Smart Group to limit the Profile to a search criteria you specify. 

For more information on Profiles, see [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/user/en/latest/organising-your-data/profiles/).

## Automation

You could automate various processes, such as sending an email to unconfirmed matches letting them know that there is a match using [CiviRules](https://civicrm.org/extensions/civirules), an extension which tracks changes within CiviCRM and then performs actions. For more information see [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/civirules/en/latest/).

## SMS

To use SMS to contact individuals or groups of members you will need an SMS provider and to instal the relevent CiviCRM SMS extension. For a list of CiviCRM SMS extensions, see [here](https://civicrm.org/extensions?title=SMS&body_value=&field_extension_cms_tid=All&field_extension_ready_value=All&sort_by=field_extension_current_usage_value&sort_order=DESC).
