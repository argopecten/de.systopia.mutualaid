# CiviCRM Mutual Aid

## Introduction

This extension helps administrators of Mutual Aid and community support groups match volunteers and needs in their local community. 

## Features

* It provides two forms â€“ Request Help and Offer Help, for volunteers and requestees to register new contacts into CiviCRM.
    *  New addresses are geocoded with Google Maps or Open Street Maps
    *  The forms can be configured to make fields optional, hide fields, or change the settings
* Suitable matches can then be searched for based on distance and skills offered or required. This creates a report of possible matches and makes a new relationship between the two contacts. 
* Administrators can then contact both parties and change the relationship status to confirm the connection.
